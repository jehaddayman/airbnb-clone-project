# Airbnb Clone Project Backend

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is a backend simulation of Airbnb. It provides a secure and scalable architecture to handle core functionalities like user authentication, property management, bookings, payments, and reviews. It helps learners gain hands-on experience with backend frameworks, database systems, and deployment pipelines.

## 👥 Team Roles
### Backend Developer
Implements REST and GraphQL APIs, manages business logic, and ensures integration with database and third-party services.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the relational schema, ensures indexing and query optimization, and handles migrations and backups.

### DevOps Engineer
Builds CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization with Docker, oversees application deployment, and ensures environment consistency.

### QA Engineer
Creates and executes test plans, automates testing, and ensures the backend adheres to quality and functional standards.

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Django**: Web framework used to build backend logic and APIs.
- **Django REST Framework**: Facilitates RESTful API development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database to store application data.
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient data querying.
- **Docker**: For containerizing and deploying the application.
- **Redis & Celery**: Used for caching and background task processing.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implements CI/CD pipelines.

## 🗃️ Database Design
### Entities:
- **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
- **Properties**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `user_id`
- **Bookings**: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
- **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`
- **Reviews**: `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **property** can have many **bookings** and **reviews**.
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**.
- A **payment** is linked to a specific **booking**.
- A **review** is created by a user for a property.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown
- **User Management**: Secure sign-up, login, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: CRUD operations for property listings.
- **Booking System**: Allow users to make and manage bookings.
- **Payment Processing**: Handles payment transactions for bookings.
- **Review System**: Enables users to leave ratings and comments on properties.

- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to restrict unauthorized actions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting API request frequency.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid data is processed.
- **HTTPS**: Protects data transmission.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
- **What is CI/CD?**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automate testing and delivery.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Runs tests, checks code, and deploys automatically.
